# Dart pact testing

Implementation of a PACT consumer for Dart

## Completed

- Verify consumer service against registered PACT interactions

## TODO

- Write PACT contracts to be consumed by provider
- Write a Dart provider implementation (not personally inspired to do this as I personally tend to use dotnet providers)
- Write some tests for the pact_provider
- Convert to a glorious package with some decent documentation
